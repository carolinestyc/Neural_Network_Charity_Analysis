# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
  Challenge 19
  
## Project Overview

During the course of this project, I was creating a machine learning model to predict if applicants who receive Alphabet Soup Co. funding will be successful. Successful is defined by classification into TRUE or FALSE. Alphabet Soup Co. wants to provide funding to everyone but they understand not all companies will be succesful. This model will help them figure out if their funding to the company will lead to successful outcomes so they don't fund companies that aren't going to succeed. 

Using data manipulation, creating training and testing sets, and analyzing the models, by creating a neural network. The results are explored below.

## Results

* Data Processing
  * ID columns "EIN" and "NAME" are removed from the model because they are not target or feature variables.
  * IS_SUCESSFUL is the target variable for the model.
  * APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT are the feature variables for the model.

## Attempt #1
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * 
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
